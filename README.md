# **GFGDebloater**

A Simple UX improvement and de-bloater for geeksforgeeks.org site. Once a good site, the current UI makes it tedious to read articles as promotions, ads, and recommended pages greatly reduce the content viewport. This extension removes all the bloat and makes the article take up the whole screen (100% width instead of the original 65%).

## **Examples**
Simple demo showing the before and after of the de-bloating.

### **Banners**
Banners the site promotions as seen in the screenshot.

#### **Before**

### **Sidebar**
The sidebar is the area that appears to the right of the article (remaining 35% of the viewport).
